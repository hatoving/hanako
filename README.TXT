~~ PREAMBLE ~~

Here it is: the entire source for "Hanako," my psycological horror game. Pretty much all of the game as of writing this is written in C using the "raylib" framework, so anyone who wants to take a crack at modifying the game or just analyze how it's written. I should note however that Hanako's code is not perfect; there may be some things here that will make the experinced C developer puke in front of their entire keyboard, so take that as you will. Another thing I will note is that you NEED THE ORIGINAL GAME FILES. I'm very much not trying to hide them (since they're scattered around in .PNGs, .OGGs and whatnot), but you need the files either way to make the build work (or, you could try to recreate all of them by youself, but who would do that?)

Now, Hanako isn't a very "flexible" game in my eyes, so I'm not sure what the community could do with this in the case of modding, however, I can think of a few things that the community COULD do with the code:

- Port it to multiple platforms (given that "raylib" can also be ported to said multiple platforms)
- Add in support for more languages for the text (which I'm planning to do either way)
- Add some game features (like built-in modding support with Lua support or somethin')
- Add in a very super secret ending where Hanako learns programming and triggers the biggest domino-chain effect of pain in her life, and in order to unlock it, you need to input several gold codes (okay, maybe not that last one actually...)

Point is, I belive in open-source software. You may do whatever you want with this, as far as you stand by the GNU license. Have fun, and keep creating.
